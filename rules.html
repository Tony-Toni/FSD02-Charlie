            <h4>Court</h4>
            <img src="images/court.png" alt="pic of court" width="350"/>
            <p class="normal">
                The standard badminton court is rectangular with a length of 13.4 meters and a width of 6.1 meters. The height of the ceiling should be greater than 6.1 meters. The net post must be fixed on the ground and the height is 1.55 meters. The height from the top of the net to the ground is 1.524 meters.

                <br><br>The field line is 40 mm wide and must be drawn with white or yellow paint, and a minimum space of 1 meter and 2 meters should be reserved from the sideline and bottom line of the court.
                
                <br><br>The badminton net is made of dark fibers, the mesh size is 15-20 mm, the net length is 6.10 meters, and the width is 0.76 meters.
                
                <br><br>Sideline: In singles, sideline is the inner sideline of the court.
                In doubles, sideline is the outside sideline of the court.
                
                <br><br>Bottom line: The bottom line for singles and doubles matches is the outermost bottom line.
            </p>
            <h4>Serving</h4>
            <img src="images/bounds.png" alt="pic of bounds" width="200" height="400"/>
            <p class="normal">
                When a player serves, both players must stand in the opposite corner of the serving area with their feet touching the ground and they must not step on the boundary of the serving court. 

                <br><br>The racket must hit the birdie bottom first and the birdie must be hit from a position lower than 115 cm. During the entire serve, the racket head should point downward. 

                <br><br>In singles, when the server's score is even, players should stand in the right serving area and prepare to serve or receive. When the server's score is odd, players should stand in the left serving area and prepare to serve or receive.

                <br><br>In doubles, when the server's score is even, players standing in the right serving area should prepare to serve or receive. When the server's score is odd, players standing in the left serving area should prepare to serve or receive. The other two players may stand wherever they wish, so long as they do not block the vision of the server or receiver.
            </p>
            <h4>Scoring</h4>
            <p class="normal">
                After the serve, the game officially begins. Players from both sides alternately hit the birdie until one side fouls or the birdie falls into one side's court. 

                <br><br>In the 21-point system, players score a point regardless of whether they serve. When a play scores, the player also gets the right to serve. When a player scores consecutively, the player alternately serves in his two serving areas. When two players reach a tie of 20 points in the game, who gains a two-point lead wins the game, except when there is a tie at 29â€“29. The score is not extended indefinitely and the winner is the first to score 30.

                <br><br>In the old 15-point system, only the server can score. In singles, if the server fails to score, the opponent will obtain the right to serve. In doubles, both players of one side have the right to serve. If the first server fails to score, the second server will continue to serve; if the second server fails to score, the opponents will have the right to serve. When players are tied for 13 or 14, the player reaching 13 or 14 points first has the option to set, whoever scores another 3 or 5 points wins the game. In women's singles, when there is a tie of 9 or 10 points, the player reaching 9 or 10 points has the option to set, whoever scores another 2 or 3 points wins the game.
